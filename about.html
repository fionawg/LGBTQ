 <p>Hi, my name is Fiona and I want to make my website about the LGBTQ+ youth community because I’m part of it and I think it’s something that should be addressed. I'm not out yet to my parents, and I'm only out to a few people. My parents are homophobic which is upsetting.
</p>
 </div>

 <div class="image-txt-container">
    <p>
      I have many friends that are also part of the community and I think that they shouldn’t be scared about coming out. It's ironic because I'm scared of coming out too and I know why they are afraid.

 <p>Many people are homophobic and young people care about what others think, especially  me. The way people see me is really important to me even though I know it shouldn't be.
</p>

      This pushed me to create this since both my parents are homophobic which is ironic since 2/3 of their kids are part of the community.
